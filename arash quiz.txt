14. Following is the code snippet to create the pong game, check the code and find error,  if any.

function draw(){
background("white");
playerPaddle.y=World.mouseY;
createEdgeSprites();
ball.bounceoff(playerPaddle);
ball.bounceoff(computerPaddle);
ball.bounceoff(edges);
drawsprites();
}

No error in code snippet
Whole code is wrong
Ball.bounceOff(edges) should be immediately after createEdgeSprites();
Ball should bounce off only from top edge and bottom edge

camera.position.x = displaywidth/2; camera.position.y = cars[index-1].y
camera.position.x = displayWidth/2; camera.position.y = cars[index-1].y
camera.position.X = displayWidth/2; camera.position.Y = cars[index-1].y
camera.position.X = displaywidth/2; camera.position.Y = cars[index-1].y


4. What is the measure you will use in console to find out the distance traveled by each car on the racing track?

player.distance
player.y
camera.position.y
